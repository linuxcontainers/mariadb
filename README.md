## What is Debian Linux?
Debian is an operating system which is composed primarily of free and open-source software, most of which is under the GNU General Public License, and developed by a group of individuals known as the Debian project. Debian is one of the most popular Linux distributions for personal computers and network servers, and has been used as a base for several other Linux distributions.

## What is MariaDB?
MariaDB Server is one of the most popular open source relational databases. Itâ€™s made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source. It is part of most cloud offerings and the default in most Linux distributions.

## Features

Minimal size only, minimal layers \
Memory usage is minimal on a simple install. \
MariaDB the MySQL replacement \

## Volume structure

* `/var/lib/mysql`: Database files
* `/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin`: MariaDB logs

## Environment Variables:

### Main Mariadb parameters:
* `MYSQL_DATABASE`: specify the name of the database
* `MYSQL_USER`: specify the User for the database
* `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: specify the User password for the database
* `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: specify the root password for Mariadb
* `MYSQL_CHARSET`: default charset (utf8) for Mariadb
* `MYSQL_COLLATION`: default collation (utf8_general_ci) for Mariadb

## Features

* Minimal size only, minimal layers
* Memory usage is minimal on a simple install

## Docker Tags and Versioning Scheme

Each image pushed to Docker Hub and the Github Container Registry is tagged as follows:
* The tag `latest` indicates, well, the latest image.
* Tags of the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (such as 10.6) indicate the SemVer of 
  the __MariaDB__ image used as the base.
* Tags of the form MAJOR.MINOR (e.g., 10) correspond to the most recent patch level of
  the __MariaDB__ image used as the base. For example, if 10.6 is the latest
  release, then 10 maps to this as well.
* Tags of the form MAJOR (e.g., 10) correspond to the most recent patch level of
  the __MariaDB__ image used as the base, with major corresponding major version. 
  For example, if 10.6 is the latest release, then 10 maps to this as well.

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) uses version numbers of the form: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where differences in MAJOR correspond
 to incompatible changes, differences in MINOR correspond to introduction of backwards compatible new functionality, and PATCH corres
ponds to backwards compatible bug fixes.


## Installation and Usage

The pre-built image is hosted on both Docker Hub and the Github Container Registry. You can use it in the following ways.

### Docker Pull Command

Pull the latest image from Docker Hub with the following (replace `latest` with 
a specific version number if you prefer):

```
docker pull linuxcontainers/mariadb:latest
```

Pull from the Github Container Registry with:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/linuxcontainers/mariadb:latest
```


### Use as a base image in a Dockerfile

Use as a base image in a Dockerfile (replace `latest` with 
a specific version number if you prefer):

```Dockerfile
FROM linuxcontainers/mariadb:latest

# The rest of your Dockerfile would go here.
```

Or you can use as a base image (via the Github Container Registry) with:

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/linuxcontainers/mariadb:latest

# The rest of your Dockerfile would go here.
```

A specific example usage can be found in the [Dockerfile of the generate-sitemap Github action](https://github.com/marketplace/action
s/generate-sitemap).
